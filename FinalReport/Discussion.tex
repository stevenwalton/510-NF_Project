\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
While these results were not the greatest, it shows that we can learn complex
probability distributions with normalizing flows and are able to fool
classifiers. We accomplished this without having a network that was anywhere
near as deep as that of the GLOW paper. We believe that with more computational
resources we could scale up our network and achieve much better results. We are
interested in if the scaling would allow for more advanced networks like ResNet
to be fooled. 

With the results that we have we can say that we accomplished our goals of
learning about normalizing flows, their usages, and how to create them. This
project has left both participants with more questions and a desire to further
research these types of networks.

%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    In this work we present a normalizing flow network based off of GLOW that is
    able to fool several deep neural network classifiers over 96\% of the time.
    This work shows that normalizing flows are able to generate quality images,
    meaning that the learn the distribution with reasonable accuracy.

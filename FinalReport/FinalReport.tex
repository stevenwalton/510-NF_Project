%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract} 
    The goal of this project was to learn about how to implement
    Normalizing Flows and demonstrate this by generating a flow that is able to
    generate x-ray images that can trick a pneumonia classifier.  In this work
    we detail our Normalizing Flow network, based off of GLOW, that is able to
    fool several deep neural network classifiers over 96\% of the time.  This
    work shows that normalizing flows are able to generate quality images,
    meaning that the learn the distribution with reasonable accuracy and that we
    could replicate a state of the art normalizing flow implementation.

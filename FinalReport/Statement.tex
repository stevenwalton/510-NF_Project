\section{Statement of Individual Contributions}
Both participants of this project contributed equally. The beginning of the
project focused on research within the area of normalizing flows. Steven
presented the idea of working with normalizing flows after reading Lilian Weng's
blog~\cite{weng2018flow} and Luis suggested using them to generate fake Covid
data, which we settled on just pneumonia cases since we found clearer and larger
datasets for that. 

The first step of the project was to build our background understanding. So we
each read NICE, RealNVP, GLOW, and FFJORD. We split these up so that each person
dug deeper on an individual paper. We then set up a Zoom meeting where we each
made slides and presented a deeper understanding of the papers to one another. 
Luis presented on NICE and FFJORD while Steven presented on RealNVP and GLOW. 

The next step both Luis and Steven independently tried to replicate the NICE
paper. When either one was confused on one section they consulted with the
other. Both ended up producing a network that was able to produce similar images
to NICE. The process was then repeated for advancing to GLOW. For the results we
used LUIS's network because his results turned out better than Steven's. We then
retrained AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG to perform a binary classification on the
pneumonia dataset.

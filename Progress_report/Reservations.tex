While models are implemented, there is still a lot of understanding to be had.
Luis's model worked best, and thus his results are shown. Still, the results are
not great and we still have a lot to learn about these models and how to improve
them. We hope that by advancing on the implementation by upgrading to a GLOW
based model will improve results, but there is still caution since we are
attempting a model that neither of us has experience with. Additionally, while
flow based models do have advantages, they are not known to generate higher
quality images than other generative models. Because of this we are wary that
our model may not be able to accurately generate new examples. In addition to
this, we now have a better understanding of training flow based models, and have
found that they take significant computational resources. This is because their
backwards functions are more complicated and have to be learned as well. This
creates a potential issue when upgrading to a GLOW based model, since there are
many more learned patterns and the model becomes more complicated.

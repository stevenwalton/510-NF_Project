\section{Updates to Project Definition}
At this point there are no major updates to the project definition. However,
   there are minor updates. In the progress task list we have switched positions
   2 and 3. The updated task list is now
\begin{enumerate} 
	\item \textbf{Literature Review}: Gaining an understanding of
		Normalizing Flows, their strengths, weaknesses and the
		situations where they can be useful. Literature review of
		relevant NF architectures NICE\cite{nice},
		RealNVP\cite{real_nvp}, FFJORD\cite{ffjord}, Glow\cite{glow}.  
	\item \textbf{Modeling With Standard Datasets}: Implement our NF model
		and test its performance by generating images from toy datasets
		like FashionMNIST and CIFAR.  
	\item \textbf{Learn by Experimentation}: Experiment with model
		architecture or new bijective functions to include in the
		flows.  
	\item \textbf{Develop Classifier}: Implement a pneumonia classifier
		using the Chest X-ray dataset (\textit{stretch goal}).  
	\item \textbf{Develop NF Pneumonia Model}: Use our NF model to generate
		fake X-ray images with pneumonia in an attempt to fool the
		classifier (\textit{stretch goal}).  
\end{enumerate}
We have made this update is it makes more sense to start with a NF model than to
experiment with bijective functions at first.

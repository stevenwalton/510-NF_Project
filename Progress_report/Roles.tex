\section{Roles/Progress Update}
Task 1 is an ongoing task throughout the project. We have currently reviewed the
four aforementioned works and generated slides and held a Zoom meeting
discussing them. Luis was in charge of generating slides for NICE and FFJORD
while Steven was in charge of generating slides for RealNVP and GLOW. Each
presented their slides to the other within a Zoom call and we discussed where
confusion lied and helped one another find more clarity. From this call we
decided to move forward and implement NICE. This way we could better understand
how the models work. The intent was to write this with as little outside help as
possible, relying as much as possible on the paper alone. 

We believe that with a month to go on the project that we are on schedule.

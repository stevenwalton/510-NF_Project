\section{Data}
Currently we are using datasets that are provided with torchvision. This is to
allow us to learn how to use flow based models and better understand them. Our
final goal will to apply this work to chest X-Ray data, which a dataset can be
found on
\href{https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia}{Kaggle}. Our
code is held in a private git repository.

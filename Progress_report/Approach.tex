\section{Approach/Next Steps}
The next steps are to update and refine the models that we are using. While NICE
is a nice model, it is not that advanced. The next improvement is to update our
model with the advances made in GLOW. GLOW uses more learned parameters, but the
results are substantially better than NICE or RealNVP. We believe that these
changes are not major, but will require more understanding of the underlying
model. We are currently on track to build a GLOW like model for our chest X-Ray
data. We are confident in our background in machine learning that we are
focusing our efforts on the new flow based models instead of the classification
network, that will later be needed. We feel that this will be the simpler part
and does not require as much reading or research to create.
